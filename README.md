## Hi there

I'm HoLLy. I used to make a lot of programs for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) or write reverse engineering tools for .NET. Now I mostly write whatever I feel like making.
I am part of the [Sandwich Group](https://github.com/Sandwich-Group).

I aim to make a lot of my stuff open source, as seen by these numbers:
